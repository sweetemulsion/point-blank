      <h1 class="section-2-heading">Our Values</h1>
      <p>How many game nights have gone awry over an argument over property in Monopoly?  We believe games should be fun for ALL (not just the super rich).  Whether you are a family of 4 or more, a couple or a group of friends, there's something for everyone.
      Our games are created by our very creative and fun team in house and shipped directly to you.  What could be more simple?
        <br>
        <br>
      Each game comes with a guarantee of fun for all and a lifetime warrenty.  Did you lose a few meeples in a move? No problem!  We'll replace them for you!
        <br>
        <br>
      Did some cards mysteriously go missing after your last game night? No problem! We'll get you the replacements (and a few spares if need be). At no cost to you!

I have been playing board games since I was little with my family and it's been a dream come true working on new games that I hope to see become family classics!  Finley and I went to business school together and spent many nights gaming with friends only to realise, there was a lack of games that everyone could agree on and we came up with the idea of Point Blank.</p>

After graduating from a prestigious graphic design school, I hit up my old friend to see if he had any job leads for me. Luckily, he was starting his own company to design games.  A life long gamer and artist? I had to get on board!</p>
